Quality control
===============

- Why raw read length values vary for each sample?

This is generally a result of the trimming generated by default in the raw data from a Illumina MiSeq run. The software 
bcl2fastq :cite:`bcl2fastq` performs basecalling and writes the sequence and quality scores into two FASTQ files per 
sample (one for R1 and one for R2), after separating demultiplexing mixed samples from the library pool by bar code indices. 

It also performs the trimming of adapter sequence in the reads beyond the genomic insert. If so, the corresponding base calls 
beyond the match will be changed to N in the resultant FASTQ file or trimmed, generating variable lengths for each read.

- Why is there a drop in quality with read length?

As an example of a Multiqc_ image of quality control of our samples, there is a progressive drop in quality with read length, less pronounced in R1 than in R2, causing R2 reads with lower mean base
quality :cite:`Tan2019`, which is expected from 300 nt long paired end reads
