Snippy
======

Snippy finds SNPs between a haploid reference genome and your NGS sequence reads. 
It will find both substitutions (snps) and insertions/deletions (indels).
It can then take a set of Snippy results using the same reference and generate a 
core SNP alignment (and ultimately a phylogenomic tree).
