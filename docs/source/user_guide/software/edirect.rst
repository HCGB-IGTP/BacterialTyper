=======

The Entrez Programming Utilities (E-utilities) are a set of eight server-side programs that 
provide a stable interface into the Entrez query and database system at the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). 

Entrez Direct (EDirect) provides access to the NCBI's suite of interconnected databases (publication, 
sequence, structure, gene, variation, expression, etc.) from a UNIX terminal window. Functions take 
search terms from command-line arguments. Individual operations are combined to build multi-step queries. 
Record retrieval and formatting normally complete the process.

EDirect also includes an argument-driven function that simplifies the extraction of data from document 
summaries or other results that are returned in structured XML format. This can eliminate the need for 
writing custom software to answer ad hoc questions. Queries can move seamlessly between EDirect commands 
and UNIX utilities or scripts to perform actions that cannot be accomplished entirely within Entrez.
