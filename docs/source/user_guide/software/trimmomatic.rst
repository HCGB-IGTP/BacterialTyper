trimmomatic
===========

Trimmomatic is a fast, multithreaded command line tool that can be used to trim and crop
Illumina (FASTQ) data as well as to remove adapters. These adapters can pose a real problem
depending on the library preparation and downstream application.

Trimmomatic works with FASTQ files (using phred + 33 or phred + 64 quality scores,
depending on the Illumina pipeline used). Files compressed using either „gzip‟ or „bzip2‟ are
supported, and are identified by use of „.gz‟ or „.bz2‟ file extensions.
