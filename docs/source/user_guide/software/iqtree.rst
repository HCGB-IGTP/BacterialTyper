IQ-TREE
=======

IQ-TREE is a software with a strong emphasis on phylogenomic inference developed 
since 2011 as open-source software under the GNU-GPL license. 

Main goals are:

** Accuracy: Proposing novel computational methods that perform better than existing approaches.

** Speed: Allowing fast analysis on big data sets and utilizing high performance computing platforms.

** Flexibility: Facilitating the inclusion of new (phylogenomic) models and sequence data types.

** Versatility: Implementing a broad range of commonly-used maximum likelihood analyses.


The name IQ-TREE comes from the fact that it is the successor of IQPNNI and TREE-PUZZLE software.
