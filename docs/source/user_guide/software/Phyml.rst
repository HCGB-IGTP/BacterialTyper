PhyML
=======

PhyML is a software that estimates maximum likelihood phylogenies from alignments 
of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The main strength of PhyML lies in the large 
number of substitution models coupled to various options to search the space of phylogenetic 
tree topologies, going from very fast and efficient methods to slower but generally 
more accurate approaches. PhyML was designed to process moderate to large data sets.
