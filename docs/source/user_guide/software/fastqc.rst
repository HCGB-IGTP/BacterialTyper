FastQC
======

FastQC is a quality control tool for high throughput sequence data. It aims to provide a simple 
way to do some quality control checks on raw sequence data coming from high throughput sequencing 
pipelines. It provides a modular set of analyses which you can use to give a quick impression of 
whether your data has any problems of which you should be aware before doing any further analysis.

The main functions of FastQC are

- Import of data from BAM, SAM or FastQ files (any variant)

- Providing a quick overview to tell you in which areas there may be problems

- Summary graphs and tables to quickly assess your data

- Export of results to an HTML based permanent report

- Offline operation to allow automated generation of reports without running the interactive application
