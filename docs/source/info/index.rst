History of BacterialTyper project
=================================

*Staphylococcus aureus* is a major bacterial pathogen causing a variety of diseases ranging from wound infections to 
severe bacteremia or intoxications. Besides host factors, the course and severity of disease is also widely dependent 
on the genotype of the  bacterium :cite:`Straus2016`. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and the following bioinformatic 
sequence analysis, is the most extensive genotyping method available but neither open, easy, direct and straighforward 
analysis are available that provide researchers with integrative genotyping information.

The BacterialTyper pipeline started as a collaboration with Dra. Cristina Prat () and Dra. Alicia Lacoma () to asses the
genotyping characteristics of a set of *S. aureus* samples.
