abstract = {Illumina's technology provides high quality reads of DNA fragments with error rates below 1/1000 per base. Sequencing runs typically generate millions of reads in which the vast majority of the reads has an average error rate below 1/1000. However, some paired-end sequencing data show the presence of a subpopulation of reads where the second read (R2) has lower average qualities. We show that the fragment length is a major driver of increased error rates in the R2 reads. Fragments above 500 nt tend to yield lower base qualities and higher error rates than shorter fragments. We use publicly available Illumina data to demonstrate that the fragment length dependency of the R2 read qualities exists in various library protocols, in different labs and using different sequencer models. Our finding extends the understanding of the Illumina read quality and has implications on error models for Illumina reads. It also sheds a light on the importance of controlling the fragment size during library preparation.},

@article{Clausen2018,
abstract = {Background: As the cost of sequencing has declined, clinical diagnostics based on next generation sequencing (NGS) have become reality. Diagnostics based on sequencing will require rapid and precise mapping against redundant databases because some of the most important determinants, such as antimicrobial resistance and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles, are highly similar to one another. In order to facilitate this, a novel mapping method, KMA (k-mer alignment), was designed. KMA is able to map raw reads directly against redundant databases, it also scales well for large redundant databases. KMA uses k-mer seeding to speed up mapping and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to accurately align extensions from k-mer seeds. Multi-mapping reads are resolved using a novel sorting scheme (ConClave scheme), ensuring an accurate selection of templates. Results: The functionality of KMA was compared with SRST2, MGmapper, BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, Minimap2 and Salmon, using both simulated data and a dataset of Escherichia coli mapped against resistance genes and core genome MLST alleles. KMA outperforms current methods with respect to both accuracy and speed, while using a comparable amount of memory. Conclusion: With KMA, it was possible map raw reads directly against redundant databases with high accuracy, speed and memory efficiency.},

abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen causing a variety of diseases ranging from wound infections to severe bacteremia or intoxications. Besides host factors, the course and severity of disease is also widely dependent on the genotype of the bacterium. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), followed by bioinformatic sequence analysis, is currently the most extensive genotyping method available. To identify clinically relevant staphylococcal virulence and resistance genes in WGS data, we developed an in silico typing scheme for the software SeqSphere- (Ridom GmbH, M{\"{u}}nster, Germany). The implemented target genes (n-182) correspond to those queried by the Identibac S. aureus Genotyping DNA microarray (Alere Technologies, Jena, Germany). The in silico scheme was evaluated by comparing the typing results of microarray and of WGS for 154 human S. aureus isolates. A total of 96.8{\%} (n-27,119) of all typing results were equally identified with microarray and WGS (40.6{\%} present and 56.2{\%} absent). Discrepancies (3.2{\%} in total) were caused by WGS errors (1.7{\%}), microarray hybridization failures (1.3{\%}), wrong prediction of ambiguous microarray results (0.1{\%}), or unknown causes (0.1{\%}). Superior to the microarray, WGS enabled the distinction of allelic variants, which may be essential for the prediction of bacterial virulence and resistance phenotypes. Multilocus sequence typing clonal complexes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element types inferred from microarray hybridization patterns were equally determined by WGS. In conclusion, WGS may substitute array-based methods due to its universal methodology, open and expandable nature, and rapid parallel analysis capacity for different characteristics in once-generated sequences.},

GIs disproportionately encode factors that enhance the adaptability and competitiveness of the microbe within a niche, including virulence factors and other medically or environmentally important adaptations. We report here the release of IslandViewer 4, with novel features to accommodate the needs of larger-scale microbial genomics analysis, while expanding GI predictions and improving its flexible visualization interface. A user management web interface as well as an HTTP API for batch analyses are now provided with a secured authentication to facilitate the submission of larger numbers of genomes and the retrieval of results. In addition, IslandViewer's integrated GI predictions from multiple methods have been improved and expanded by integrating the precise Islander method for pre-computed genomes, as well as an updated IslandPath-DIMOB for both pre-computed and user-supplied custom genome analysis. Finally, pre-computed predictions including virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance are now available for 6193 complete bacterial and archaeal strains publicly available in RefSeq. IslandViewer 4 provides key enhancements to facilitate the analysis of GIs and better understand their role in the evolution of successful environmental microbes and pathogens.},

Intensified studies on bacterial pathogenesis have greatly expanded our knowledge about the mechanisms of the disease processes at the molecular level over the last decades. To facilitate future research, it becomes necessary to form a database collectively presenting the virulence factors (VFs) of various medical significant bacterial pathogens. The aim of virulence factor database (VFDB) (http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/) is to provide such a source for scientists to rapidly access to current knowledge about VFs from various bacterial pathogens. VFDB is comprehensive and user-friendly. One can search VFDB by browsing each genus or by typing keywords. Furthermore, a BLAST search tool against all known VF-related genes is also available.

abstract = {The virulence factor database (VFDB, http://www.mgc.ac.cn/VFs/) is devoted to providing the scientific community with a comprehensive warehouse and online platform for deciphering bacterial pathogenesis. The various combinations, organizations and expressions of virulence factors (VFs) are responsible for the diverse clinical symptoms of pathogen infections. Currently, whole-genome sequencing is widely used to decode potential novel or variant pathogens both in emergent outbreaks and in routine clinical practice. However, the efficient characterization of pathogenomic compositions remains a challenge for microbiologists or physicians with limited bioinformatics skills. Therefore, we introduced to VFDB an integrated and automatic pipeline, VFanalyzer, to systematically identify known/potential VFs in complete/draft bacterial genomes. VFanalyzer first constructs orthologous groups within the query genome and preanalyzed reference genomes from VFDB to avoid potential false positives due to paralogs. Then, it conducts iterative and exhaustive sequence similarity searches among the hierarchical prebuilt datasets of VFDB to accurately identify potential untypical/strain-specific VFs. Finally, via a context-based data refinement process for VFs encoded by gene clusters, VFanalyzer can achieve relatively high specificity and sensitivity without manual curation. In addition, a thoroughly optimized interactive web interface is introduced to present VFanalyzer reports in comparative pathogenomic style for easy online analysis.},

abstract = {Objectives We present the results of two European external quality assessments (EQAs) conducted in 2014 and 2016 under the auspices of the Study Group on Staphylococci and Staphylococcal Infections of ESCMID. The objective was to assess the performance of participating centres in characterizing Staphylococcus aureus using their standard in-house phenotypic and genotypic protocols. Methods A total of 11 well-characterized blindly coded S. aureus (n = 9), Staphylococcus argenteus (n = 1) and Staphylococcus capitis (n = 1) strains were distributed to participants for analysis. Species identification, MIC determination, antimicrobial susceptibility testing, antimicrobial resistance and toxin gene detection and molecular typing including spa typing, SCCmec typing and MLST were performed. Results Thirteen laboratories from 12 European countries participated in one EQA or both EQAs. Despite considerable diversity in the methods employed, good concordance (90{\%}-100{\%}) with expected results was obtained. Discrepancies were observed for: (i) identification of the S. argenteus strain; (ii) phenotypic detection of low-level resistance to oxacillin in the mecC-positive strain; (iii) phenotypic detection of the inducible MLSB strain; and (iv) WGS-based detection of some resistance and toxin genes. Conclusions Overall, good concordance (90{\%}-100{\%}) with expected results was observed. In some instances, the accurate detection of resistance and toxin genes from WGS data proved problematic, highlighting the need for validated and internationally agreed-on bioinformatics pipelines before such techniques are implemented routinely by microbiology laboratories. We strongly recommend all national reference laboratories and laboratories acting as referral centres to participate in such EQA initiatives.},
