abstract = {Illumina's technology provides high quality reads of DNA fragments with error rates below 1/1000 per base. Sequencing runs typically generate millions of reads in which the vast majority of the reads has an average error rate below 1/1000. However, some paired-end sequencing data show the presence of a subpopulation of reads where the second read (R2) has lower average qualities. We show that the fragment length is a major driver of increased error rates in the R2 reads. Fragments above 500 nt tend to yield lower base qualities and higher error rates than shorter fragments. We use publicly available Illumina data to demonstrate that the fragment length dependency of the R2 read qualities exists in various library protocols, in different labs and using different sequencer models. Our finding extends the understanding of the Illumina read quality and has implications on error models for Illumina reads. It also sheds a light on the importance of controlling the fragment size during library preparation.},

@article{Clausen2018,
abstract = {Background: As the cost of sequencing has declined, clinical diagnostics based on next generation sequencing (NGS) have become reality. Diagnostics based on sequencing will require rapid and precise mapping against redundant databases because some of the most important determinants, such as antimicrobial resistance and core genome multilocus sequence typing (MLST) alleles, are highly similar to one another. In order to facilitate this, a novel mapping method, KMA (k-mer alignment), was designed. KMA is able to map raw reads directly against redundant databases, it also scales well for large redundant databases. KMA uses k-mer seeding to speed up mapping and the Needleman-Wunsch algorithm to accurately align extensions from k-mer seeds. Multi-mapping reads are resolved using a novel sorting scheme (ConClave scheme), ensuring an accurate selection of templates. Results: The functionality of KMA was compared with SRST2, MGmapper, BWA-MEM, Bowtie2, Minimap2 and Salmon, using both simulated data and a dataset of Escherichia coli mapped against resistance genes and core genome MLST alleles. KMA outperforms current methods with respect to both accuracy and speed, while using a comparable amount of memory. Conclusion: With KMA, it was possible map raw reads directly against redundant databases with high accuracy, speed and memory efficiency.},

abstract = {Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major threats to human and animal health worldwide, yet few high-throughput tools exist to analyse and predict the resistance of a bacterial isolate from sequencing data. Here we present a new tool, ARIBA, that identifies AMR-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms directly from short reads, and generates detailed and customizable output. The accuracy and advantages of ARIBA over other tools are demonstrated on three datasets from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with ARIBA outperforming existing methods.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT Motivation: Genomics has revolutionised biological research, but quality assessment of the resulting assembled sequences is compli- cated and remains mostly limited to technical measures like N50. Results: We propose a measure for quantitative assessment of genome assembly and annotation completeness based on evolu- tionarily informed expectations of gene content. We implemented the assessment procedure in open-source software, with sets of Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs, named BUSCO.

@article{Straus2016,
abstract = {Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen causing a variety of diseases ranging from wound infections to severe bacteremia or intoxications. Besides host factors, the course and severity of disease is also widely dependent on the genotype of the bacterium. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS), followed by bioinformatic sequence analysis, is currently the most extensive genotyping method available. To identify clinically relevant staphylococcal virulence and resistance genes in WGS data, we developed an in silico typing scheme for the software SeqSphere- (Ridom GmbH, M{\"{u}}nster, Germany). The implemented target genes (n-182) correspond to those queried by the Identibac S. aureus Genotyping DNA microarray (Alere Technologies, Jena, Germany). The in silico scheme was evaluated by comparing the typing results of microarray and of WGS for 154 human S. aureus isolates. A total of 96.8{\%} (n-27,119) of all typing results were equally identified with microarray and WGS (40.6{\%} present and 56.2{\%} absent). Discrepancies (3.2{\%} in total) were caused by WGS errors (1.7{\%}), microarray hybridization failures (1.3{\%}), wrong prediction of ambiguous microarray results (0.1{\%}), or unknown causes (0.1{\%}). Superior to the microarray, WGS enabled the distinction of allelic variants, which may be essential for the prediction of bacterial virulence and resistance phenotypes. Multilocus sequence typing clonal complexes and staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec element types inferred from microarray hybridization patterns were equally determined by WGS. In conclusion, WGS may substitute array-based methods due to its universal methodology, open and expandable nature, and rapid parallel analysis capacity for different characteristics in once-generated sequences.},
